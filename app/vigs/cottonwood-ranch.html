                        <p>Little thought was given to ecological impacts during the era of major dam building in the arid West in first half of the 20th century. But when the federal licenses to operate those dams came due for renewal 50 years later during the dawn of the environmental movement, they faced a slew of new legislation focused on mitigating human impact on the natural world: particularly the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973.</p>
                        <p>In Nebraska, some of this drama played out toward the end of the 20th century on Lake McConaughy, the state’s biggest body of water. Built in the 1930s and ‘40s with federal funding, the reservoir dams the North Platte River behind the three-mile long face of Kingsley Dam.</p>
                        <p>Kingsley Dam and the related Keystone Diversion Dam were built by the Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District and Nebraska Public Power District, respectively, to provide irrigation water and hydroelectric power for counties in south-central Nebraska. But the projects further reduced water flows and altered habitat downstream that had already been degraded by upstream dams and diversions in Wyoming and Colorado. When the districts applied to renew their hydroelectric project licenses in 1984, they were deemed deficient because they failed to consider the impacts to endangered and other wildlife species. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted the districts interim licenses while they addressed the habitat needs for four species: the endangered whooping crane, least tern, pallid sturgeon, and the threatened piping plover, under the recently enacted national environmental legislation.</p>

                        <p>For the next decade, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) worked on an in-depth environmental impact report. Through the 1990s, the agency proposed different versions of the study and methods of addressing endangered species requirements for water and habitat. Wildlife conservation groups, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criticized the plans as inadequate, while water users and public power districts deemed them too radical or expensive to accomplish.</p>
                        <p>This relicensing process was one of several such conflicts in the Platte River Basin as irrigators, federal dam operators and government agencies worked to address new requirements for endangered species. After years of litigation and disputes trying to handle and resolve each case individually, in 1994, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Interior to tackle them collectively.</p>
                        <p>As part of its negotiations with the Fish and Wildlife Service, in 1992 Nebraska Public Power District bought the Cottonwood Ranch, a 2650-acre property on the Platte River just southeast of Overton.</p>

                        <p>In 1997, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado and the Department of the Interior reached an agreement on a basin-wide plan for managing resources with regard to wildlife, signing a cooperative agreement laying out an approach to providing water, land and funding to meet the needs of the Platte River’s endangered species. A year later the public power and irrigation districts, Fish and Wildlife Service, federal energy regulators and conservation and wildlife groups reached settlement on the relicensing of Kingsley Dam and the Keystone Diversion Dam. FERC issued new 40-year licenses for the hydropower facilities, which included the creation of an “environmental account” of water at Lake McConaughy specifically set aside to support endangered and other wildlife, and required the districts to acquire and manage dedicated habitat complexes along the river channel.</p>
                        <p>While negotiations on the cooperative agreement advanced toward what would eventually become the <a href="https://www.platteriverprogram.org/Pages/Default.aspx" target=blank>Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP)</a>, Nebraska Public Power District began large restoration and habitat management projects on Cottonwood Ranch. They tore out acres of trees, widened the channel and restored 30 acres of wetland habitat.</p>
                        <p>Since its inception in 2007, PRRIP has taken over management activities on Cottonwood Ranch and added a few adjacent parcels to expand the habitat complex. In 2011, PRRIP built an experimental off-channel island for tern and plover nesting habitat. Efforts like those at Cottonwood Ranch are part of an evolving system of complex habitat management for endangered species in the Platte River Basin.</p>

                                        <p>In 2011, the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP) constructed <span class="link-text" id="link-3">a large sandbar </span> off-channel to provide nesting habitat for piping plovers and least terns. The site allows PRRIP to study whether the birds prefer off-channel or in-channel habitat.</p>
                                        <p>They also burned wet meadow grasslands and added more sediment to the river channel.</p>
                                        <p>South of the river, Ducks Unlimited began major restoration <span class="link-text" id="link-9">on a wetland</span>, providing habitat for migratory waterfowl.</p>

                                        <p>Taken as a whole, work along the central Platte in the last decade represents an overall shift in modern conservation efforts: managing habitat as diverse complexes rather than individual land parcels and relying on collaborative efforts between conservation partners along the river.</p>
