                        <p>Little thought was given to ecological impacts during the era of major dam building in the arid West in the early 20th century. But when those federal licenses came due for renewal 50 years later during the advent of the environmental movement, they faced a slew of new legislation to address those impacts.</p>
                        <p>In Nebraska, this drama played out toward the end of the 20th century on Lake McConaughy, the state’s biggest body of water. Built in the 1930s and ‘40s with federal funding, the reservoir dammed the North Platte River behind the three-mile long face of Kingsley Dam.</p>
                        <p>Kingsley Dam and the related North Platte/Keystone Diversion Dam were built to provide irrigation water and hydroelectric power for counties in south-central Nebraska, but the project also had impacts on water flows and habitat downstream. When Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District applied for a new license for its Kingsley Dam hydropower plant in 1984, it was denied because it failed to consider impacts to endangered species, and given a six year extension to complete those studies. A few years later, in 1987, the original license for Kingsley Dam and the Keystone Diversion Dam expired. The project owners, CNPPID and Nebraska Public Power District, were granted interim licenses while they addressed endangered species requirements.</p>
                        <p>For the next decade, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) conducted studies and worked on an in-depth environmental impact report. The first version, in 1992, received criticism from wildlife groups, farmers and the Environmental Protection Agency who stated it did not “adequately assess the potentially significant environmental effect,” nor did it identify and analyze all reasonable alternatives.</p>
                        <p>The next version of the plan, released in 1994, included the creation of an “environmental account” of water at Lake McConaughy specifically set aside to support wildlife habitat. However CNPPID was deeply concerned about the mitigation the plan required.</p>
                        <p>This wasn’t the only such conflict at play with endangered species in the Platte River Basin. In response to years of litigation and water disputes, in June 1994, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the U.S. Department of the Interior to develop a basin-wide solution to share responsibility for protecting endangered species along the Platte River.</p>
                        <p>In its 1996 biological opinion, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found FERC’s relicensing plan inadequate, stating that “while addressing many of the environmental concerns regarding endangered species, [it] is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the endangered whooping crane, least tern, pallid sturgeon, and the threatened piping plover.” In addition, USFWS believed the plan would result in the destruction of federally designated critical whooping crane habitat on the central Platte River. The decision proposed two alternatives, both of which required licensees (the public power and irrigation companies) to create and restore dedicated habitat complexes along the river channel.</p>
                        <p>Anticipating these requirementsTKTK, in 1992TK Nebraska Public Power District bought the Cottonwood Ranch, a 2650-acre complex on the Platte River just south of OvertonTK, as well as some additional properties downstreamTK.</p>
                        <p>In 1997, Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado and the Department of the Interior reached an agreement on a basin-wide plan for endangered species, signing a cooperative agreement laying out an approach to providing water, land and funding to meet the needs of the Platte River’s endangered species. This agreement settled years of lawsuits and conflicts between the states, federal government, NPPD, CNPPID, National Audubon Society, The Whooping Crane Trust, and water users. A year later they reached settlement on the relicensing of Kingsley Dam and the Keystone/North Platte Dam, and FERC issued a new 40-year license for the hydropower facilities.</p>

                        <p>While negotiations on the tri-state cooperative agreement moved toward what would eventually become the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program, NPPD began large restoration and habitat projects on Cottonwood Ranch. They tore out acres of trees, reshaped canal systems, and built a 30-acre wetland.</p>
                        <p>Since its inception in 2007, PRRIP has taken over management activities on Cottonwood Ranch, (though NPPD still retains ownership) and added a few parcels surrounding it. In 2010TK, PRRIP built an experimental off-channel island habitat for terns and plovers. The program and efforts like those at Cottonwood Ranch are part of a system of complex watershed management for endangered species in the Platte River Basin. After the headquarters of the Crane Trust, Cottonwood Ranch is the largest habitat complex in the Central Platte Valley.</p>
