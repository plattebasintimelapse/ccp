                            <p>In the last century, farms on the central Platte have grown in size and reduced in number. Production skyrocketed with the introduction of fertilizers, pesticides and hybrid seeds. And center pivot technology expanded widely, drastically changing the nature of irrigation.</p>
                            <p>Today, an estimated 75 percent of the total freshwater withdrawn for irrigation in Nebraska comes from underground. Irrigation canal systems, built to transport river water to fields a century ago, can seem like inefficient relics of the past compared to 21st century precision pumping technologies. But with the water table just eight to 10 feet beneath the surface, the porous canals and reservoirs are now recognized as important mechanisms for groundwater recharge and contributing flows back to the Platte River. Some of these century-old canals are currently undergoing a major rehabilitation to increase efficiency for irrigation and to better manage water flows for multiple water users – including endangered species.</p>

                            <p>The Orchard Alfalfa Canal, south of Cozad, has been in use since its water right was approved in 1898. In 2013, the Central Platte Natural Resources District (CPNRD) began a major rehabilitation of the canal, which irrigates more than 4,000 acres of land. A large part of the $4 million project involved the installation of a new water diversion structure, now equipped with an electric slide gate to better control flows – a big improvement in efficiency from the manual gate systems. In addition, trees and other plants were removed from the canals to allow for a certain amount of seepage back into the ground. CPNRD is working with local surface irrigation districts to implement similar work on three other central Platte valley systems – rehabbing a total of 65 miles of canals.</p>
                            <p>Irrigation canals play an important role in water balance. When they are cleared and graded, canals serve as natural recharge points for the aquifer below, helping maintain groundwater supplies for irrigation.</p>

                            <p>On a landscape scale, the natural connection between surface water and groundwater via canals is an important tool for managing water levels and protecting endangered species dependent on river water. A prominent example is the least tern, which feeds on minnows and other small fish. In the summer months, when the Platte River is the lowest because of irrigation water use, it is crucial to maintain enough in-stream flow to keep the fish alive.</p>
                            <p>Canals can do this by retiming flows, supplying water back to the river directly at critical points. By recharging groundwater, canals can elevate the water table, adding more flows to the river.</p>
                            <p>This habitat work related to canals is also made possible by farmers who work with the Natural Resources Districts to voluntarily trade surface water for groundwater. The surface water that they’d normally apply to their fields is allowed to go back into the Platte River, either directly via the canals, or through groundwater recharge. The NRDs can then manage surface water as necessary, retiming flows to meet federally-mandated targets for endangered species, like the least tern, piping plover and whooping crane.</p>
