                            <p>For two decades Fort Kearny served as a symbol of westward expansion, an outpost on the frontier protecting settlers as they headed west.</p>
                            <p>The United States Army established Fort Kearny in 1848 at the site where several smaller overland trails merged into the wider Oregon Trail to provide protection and supplies to wagon trains and other travelers. The original Fort Kearny was constructed near present-day Nebraska City, but was moved to its final spot near what would become the city of Kearney, Neb., when the army noticed that few travelers passed by the original site. Initially named Fort Childs, it was renamed after General Stephen Watts Kearny, a hero of the War of 1812 and the Mexican-American War who had scouted the original site.</p>
                            <p>During the height of the westward migration, thousands of wagons traveling to Oregon, California and other western destinations passed the fort each year. There were also a steady stream of freight wagons that resupplied the fort and travelers with food, ammunition and spare parts. For a brief period from XXXX to XXXX, the fort also served as a stop for the Pony Express, the transcontinental mail delivery service that predated the Union Pacific Railroad.</p>
                            <p>While the early years at the fort were peaceful, after the creation of the Nebraska Territory with the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and the influx of emigrants and settlers drove off wild game, hostile activity by Cheyenne and Sioux tribes increased in the area. The fort became a refuge for those fleeing the attacks on wagon trains and a military outfitting post for various armed conflicts between the Army and Native American tribes. While Kearny was never a proper walled fort, earthen barricades were constructed around the group of buildings during this period. In the mid-1860s, conflict shifted further west, away from the fort.</p>
                            <p>Construction on the Union-Pacific Railroad across Nebraska slowed the flow of wagon trains across the state.  After construction finished in 1869, orders were given for Fort Kearny to be abandoned on May 22, 1871. The soldiers were re-stationed to Omaha, the buildings torn down and its stores moved to Fort McPherson further west. In 1876, the area Fort Kearny had occupied was turned over to the Department of the Interior. Within a few years, all that remained of the fort were the earthen barriers.</p>
                            <p>Today, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission operates Fort Kearny State Historical Park on the site, where several buildings, including a carpenter-blacksmith shop, have been reconstructed for visitors. Some of the cottonwood trees surrounding the area are more than a century old. The difference between the spelling of the fort’s name and the nearby town of Kearney originates from repeated post office errors.</p>

                            <p>The SNOTEL system has been in place for decades, transmitting data back to centralized offices where it’s assessed and compiled into public reports. But it complements an even older method of data collection: manual snow surveys.</p>
                            <p>From January through May, snow survey teams ski, snowshoe or snowmobile to remote sites, often weathering sleet, blizzards or ice storms. They return to specific locations year after year, collecting snowpack data to help determine the supply for the coming water year.</p>
