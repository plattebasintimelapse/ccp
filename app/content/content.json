				"For thousands of years, climate was the principal force on the Platte River. The harsh extremes of prairie winters, stormy summers, drought, flood, and unrelenting winds shaped its wide channels and meanders. On the ground, millions of bison, the rugged Great Plains megafauna, used to trample earth, churn soil, graze grasses. Prairie fires raced across the landscape, turning grass into a carbon-rich delicacy for animals of all kinds. Ice formed in blocky sheets that carried gravel and knocked trees loose as they scraped down sandy straits. Each spring, snowmelt swept down from the mountains out to the broad, sinuous channels, reshaping sandbars, scouring vegetation, creating waterways anew."

			},{ "graf":

				"Native American groups, especially the Pawnee, settled along the central stretch of the river and built villages along the banks. The historic prairie river was wide and shallow, with braided channels supporting a wide variety habitat and diverse ecological systems. The Pawnee hunted buffalo and other game across the plains, and farmed in the fertile soils of the river floodplain."

			},{ "graf":

				"Towards the end of the nineteenth century, things began to change. Starting with western explorers like Lewis and Clark, followed soon after by the fur trade trappers, westward expansion brought increasing numbers of settlers to the region. The human impact on the river grew. The U.S. government started moving Native American groups from their historical territories around the plains in the early 1800s, and continued through the homestead and land grant era."

				"For much of the 1800s, waves of westbound settlers—Gold Rush hopefuls, Mormons, eager homesteaders, lured by fortune and adventure in the frontier carted their wagons across the country, following trails along the Platte, giving it the name, “The Great Platte River Road.” Some travelers stayed, living off the land, chopping down riparian forests for timber. Soon the railroad followed, and in its wake scores of small towns and bridges began to cross the broad, languid river. Irrigation canals took root at points all along its length, pulling water out of the river for crops and livestock. Starting in the early twentieth century, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began building dams and diversions in the headwaters, significantly changing the river system."

			},{ "graf":

				"The Platte evolved as a river of disturbance. But with these changes, the Platte’s nature of ever-constant change began to stagnate. River channels no longer flooded in spring, with water held back by dams or diverted for irrigation. Sandbars grew dense with woody vegetation. Birds struggled to find the habitat they had used on the Platte for centuries, instead finding fields of corn and beans."

			},{ "graf":

				"Now, Platte River flows are estimated to be only a quarter of what they were historically. And the river channel width, in many places have been reduced by the same amount or more. By the early twentieth century, human activity, rather than climate, became the dominant factor shaping the Platte River."

				"The mid-twentieth century brought a new wave of social awareness about the natural world and human impact on the environment. Some of these concerns centered around the Platte River, mostly because of one large bird."
			},{ "graf":
				"The whooping crane (grus Americana) stands five feet tall, a beautiful, graceful bird with nearly all-white plumage. As they have for centuries, each spring they migrate from their breeding grounds on the Texas Gulf Coast to their summer grounds in Alaska, stopping over at wetlands throughout the Great Plains, particularly the Platte River in central Nebraska."
			},{ "graf":
				"As dams and diversions for agriculture, cities and hydropower significantly reduced flows through the central Platte in the late 1800s and early 1900s, vegetation normally scoured out by spring floods instead took root, and habitat for cranes and other species diminished substantially. Cranes prefer shallow rivers and sandbars for roosting, and a wide field of view to spot predators. Gallery forests taking over shorelines made wide stretches of the Platte far less suitable habitat, and threatened the bird’s survival."
			},{ "graf":
				"By the middle of the twentieth century, complex international and cultural factors brought the nation into a rising tide of social consciousness. For many Americans, the 1950s, 60s and 70s were defined by movements advocating for the rights of minorities, women, gays and lesbians, and the environment. Congress passed a series of laws to protect some of these rights."
			},{ "graf":
				"For environmental activists in the Great Plains, the whooping crane became a cause celebre—a charismatic bird under threat that symbolized the need for environmental protections. Its listing as one of the first endangered species paralleled the national turn of attention to the environment, earning that status in the same few years that most bedrock environmental laws were passed."
			},{ "graf":
				"When a new dam was proposed on the Laramie River, a tributary of the North Platte in Wyoming, environmental groups mobilized the recently-passed endangered species legislation to fight it, arguing it would further destroy habitat for one of the first endangered species. Opponents to the hydropower project also included the state of Nebraska, concerned about wildlife and irrigation needs downstream."
			},{ "graf":
				"After a series of negotiations and lawsuits, parties finally reached agreement in 1978—allowing the Grayrocks Dam construction to proceed as long as the power company funded the creation of an organization and land dedicated to preserving and protecting whooping crane habitat."
			},{ "graf":
				"The Crane Trust joined other conservation groups already active on the central Platte, working to restore or conserve habitat for the whooping crane and other wildlife species."
			},{ "graf":
				"Twenty years after the Grayrocks conflict, whooping crane habitat preservation once again challenged an upstream hydropower project: this time, the relicensing of Kingsley Dam at Lake McConaughy and Keystone/North Platte Diversion Dam."
			},{ "graf":
				"As before, it took years of negotiations between public power entities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska before they finally settled on an agreement to protect endangered species on the Platte River. The agreement created a federal and state recovery plan, the details of which took another decade to iron out. Finally in 2007, the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program began—a collaborative effort between the three states, federal government and conservation partners to protect and preserve habitat for four threatened and endangered species in the Platte River: the piping plover, whooping crane, least tern and pallid sturgeon."

				"Each spring, the skies above central Nebraska fill with millions of birds. Nearly 80 percent of the continental population of sandhill cranes migrates through the Platte River Valley, along with a few wild whooping cranes and millions of other waterfowl."
			},{ "graf":
				"It’s an incredible spectacle witnessed by residents and tourists alike. But many who observe the silver streams of wings may not realize it’s largely a human-created phenomenon and a visible result of an ecosystem in stress."
			},{ "graf":
				"Sandhill and whooping cranes, as well as many other birds, have migrated through the Central Platte Valley for eons. The Platte River offered refuge for birds on their way north, but historically they traversed a much greater span of the river than they do today, foraging in marshes and wet meadows and roosting on shallow sandbars."
			},{ "graf":
				"As human impacts began to change the character of the river, suitable habitat along its length began to disappear. But the conversion of wetland habitat to irrigated agriculture along the river floodplain had an unexpected benefit for some birds: waste corn left over from the previous fall’s harvest. For decades this rich food source in fields near the river has helped cranes build fat reserves for the journey to the frigid high north to breed, but in recent years, more efficient harvesting practices have diminished this alternate food source as well."
			},{ "graf":
				"Like many rivers, the Platte has a complicated past. One of the outcomes of the Platte’s recent litigious history is today’s high concentration of federal, state, and private entities working toward conservation in a 50 mile stretch of the central Platte, often referred to as the “Big Bend” region."
			},{ "graf":
				"While groups like Audubon and the Crane Trust have owned conservation lands for nearly 40 years, since 2007, the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program (PRRIP) has led coordinated restoration efforts among partners on the Big Bend stretch of the river. They are the most recent member of a loose collective of federal, state and private organizations and people who have spent decades working on these issues along the Platte. While many groups work together on specific projects or goals, each group has distinct priorities and work methods."
			},{ "graf":
				"This patchwork of restoration efforts results in a rich tapestry of experimentation and learning on the central Platte, much of which remains a working landscape. Most of the groups active in the river valley agree their habitat work is made better by it, since diverse opinions and approaches foster ongoing conversation about best practices for twenty-first century river management."
			},{ "graf":
				"This complex collection of various federal, state, and private groups use most of the same tools and techniques to accomplish wildlife and habitat restoration/preservation in the central Platte. Those include finding ways to return more water back to the river, removing vegetation from the river channel and creating artificially-engineered sandbars and shallows that provide critical roosts for cranes and nesting habitat for terns and plovers. It also means employing modern techniques to mimic the historical disturbances on the river valley, like managing wetlands and grasslands with fire and cattle."
			},{ "graf":
				"The goal of these groups is not to restore the Platte to a certain time in the past, a time when the river may have been considered more “pristine.” Rivers are ever changing; they continue to evolve in response to complex conditions and environmental factors. Rather, the groups try to work within the complicated set of modern demands on the river to maximize benefits for the species they’re targeting. That means cooperation between what some might consider unusual wildlife partners, like power companies and irrigation districts."
			},{ "graf":
				"Private landowners also play a large role, working with groups to allow conservation work on their properties. That’s important because nearly the entire state of Nebraska, including most of the lands along the Platte, is privately owned. Still, sentiment in the central Platte isn’t uniformly in support of restoration—some multigenerational farmers criticize the land acquisition by conservation groups and feel they’re being pushed out of the river valley, or question the value and need of the habitat work itself."
			},{ "graf":
				"Biologists believe the current concentrated migration of sandhill cranes through central Nebraska—a point of pride for many in the state—is much greater than it was in centuries past as a result of our impacts on the river. Without the year-round efforts of these various groups and landowners, it’s unlikely we’d see anything like the crane migration spectacle each spring, or the diversity of species that thrive in the central Platte every year."
