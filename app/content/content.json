				"For thousands of years, climate was the principal force on the Platte River. The harsh extremes of prairie winters, stormy summers, drought, flood, and unrelenting winds shaped its wide channels and meanders. On the ground, millions of bison, the rugged Great Plains megafauna, used to trample earth, churn soil, graze grasses. Prairie fires raced across the landscape, turning grass into a carbon-rich delicacy for animals of all kinds. Ice formed in blocky sheets that carried gravel and knocked trees loose as they scraped down sandy straits. Each spring, snowmelt swept down from the mountains out to the broad, sinuous channels, reshaping sandbars, scouring vegetation, creating waterways anew."

			},{ "graf":

				"Native American groups, especially the Pawnee, settled along the central stretch of the river and built villages along the banks. The historic prairie river was wide and shallow, with braided channels supporting a wide variety habitat and diverse ecological systems. The Pawnee hunted buffalo and other game across the plains, and farmed in the fertile soils of the river floodplain."

			},{ "graf":

				"Towards the end of the nineteenth century, things began to change. Starting with western explorers like Lewis and Clark, followed soon after by the fur trade trappers, westward expansion brought increasing numbers of settlers to the region. The human impact on the river grew. The U.S. government started moving Native American groups from their historical territories around the plains in the early 1800s, and continued through the homestead and land grant era."

				"For much of the 1800s, waves of westbound settlers—Gold Rush hopefuls, Mormons, eager homesteaders, lured by fortune and adventure in the frontier carted their wagons across the country, following trails along the Platte, giving it the name, “The Great Platte River Road.” Some travelers stayed, living off the land, chopping down riparian forests for timber. Soon the railroad followed, and in its wake scores of small towns and bridges began to cross the broad, languid river. Irrigation canals took root at points all along its length, pulling water out of the river for crops and livestock. Starting in the early twentieth century, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began building dams and diversions in the headwaters, significantly changing the river system."

			},{ "graf":

				"The Platte evolved as a river of disturbance. But with these changes, the Platte’s nature of ever-constant change began to stagnate. River channels no longer flooded in spring, with water held back by dams or diverted for irrigation. Sandbars grew dense with woody vegetation. Birds struggled to find the habitat they had used on the Platte for centuries, instead finding fields of corn and beans."

			},{ "graf":

				"Now, Platte River flows are estimated to be only a quarter of what they were historically. And the river channel width, in many places have been reduced by the same amount or more. By the early twentieth century, human activity, rather than climate, became the dominant factor shaping the Platte River."

				"The mid-twentieth century brought a new wave of social awareness about the natural world and human impact on the environment. Some of these concerns centered around the Platte River, mostly because of one large bird."
			},{ "graf":
				"The whooping crane (grus Americana) stands five feet tall, a beautiful, graceful bird with nearly all-white plumage. As they have for centuries, each spring they migrate from their breeding grounds on the Texas Gulf Coast to their summer grounds in Alaska, stopping over at wetlands throughout the Great Plains, particularly the Platte River in central Nebraska."
			},{ "graf":
				"As dams and diversions for agriculture, cities and hydropower significantly reduced flows through the central Platte in the late 1800s and early 1900s, vegetation normally scoured out by spring floods instead took root, and habitat for cranes and other species diminished substantially. Cranes prefer shallow rivers and sandbars for roosting, and a wide field of view to spot predators. Gallery forests taking over shorelines made wide stretches of the Platte far less suitable habitat, and threatened the bird’s survival."
			},{ "graf":
				"By the middle of the twentieth century, complex international and cultural factors brought the nation into a rising tide of social consciousness. For many Americans, the 1950s, 60s and 70s were defined by movements advocating for the rights of minorities, women, gays and lesbians, and the environment. Congress passed a series of laws to protect some of these rights."
			},{ "graf":
				"For environmental activists in the Great Plains, the whooping crane became a cause celebre—a charismatic bird under threat that symbolized the need for environmental protections. Its listing as one of the first endangered species paralleled the national turn of attention to the environment, earning that status in the same few years that most bedrock environmental laws were passed."
			},{ "graf":
				"When a new dam was proposed on the Laramie River, a tributary of the North Platte in Wyoming, environmental groups mobilized the recently-passed endangered species legislation to fight it, arguing it would further destroy habitat for one of the first endangered species. Opponents to the hydropower project also included the state of Nebraska, concerned about wildlife and irrigation needs downstream."
			},{ "graf":
				"After a series of negotiations and lawsuits, parties finally reached agreement in 1978—allowing the Grayrocks Dam construction to proceed as long as the power company funded the creation of an organization and land dedicated to preserving and protecting whooping crane habitat."
			},{ "graf":
				"The Crane Trust joined other conservation groups already active on the central Platte, working to restore or conserve habitat for the whooping crane and other wildlife species."
			},{ "graf":
				"Twenty years after the Grayrocks conflict, whooping crane habitat preservation once again challenged an upstream hydropower project: this time, the relicensing of Kingsley Dam at Lake McConaughy and Keystone/North Platte Diversion Dam."
			},{ "graf":
				"As before, it took years of negotiations between public power entities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states of Colorado, Wyoming and Nebraska before they finally settled on an agreement to protect endangered species on the Platte River. The agreement created a federal and state recovery plan, the details of which took another decade to iron out. Finally in 2007, the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program began—a collaborative effort between the three states, federal government and conservation partners to protect and preserve habitat for four threatened and endangered species in the Platte River: the piping plover, whooping crane, least tern and pallid sturgeon."
