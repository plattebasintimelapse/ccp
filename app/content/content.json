				"If every river is a story, the Platte would be one full of seasonal shift, of latent drama, of constant change."

			},{ "graf":

				"For thousands of years, climate shaped its channels and meanders: the harsh extremes of prairie winters, stormy summers, and unrelenting winds. Millions of bison, the rugged Great Plains megafauna, used to trample earth, churn soil, graze down plants. Prairie fires raced across the landscape, turning grass into a carbon-rich delicacy for animals of all kinds. Ice formed and knocked trees loose as they scraped down sandy straits. Each spring, snowmelt swept down from the mountains out to the winding, sinewy channels, reshaping sandbars, scouring vegetation, creating waterways anew."

			},{ "graf":

				"In the nineteenth century, that began to change. As westward expansion brought increasing numbers of settlers to the region, the human impact on the river grew, and by the twentieth century took the place of climate as the dominant factor shaping the river."

			},{ "graf":

				"reductions in average flows which creates size (width) of river, and peak flows, like spring floods, that scours channels, reforms sandbars and removes vegetation. Both of those factors lead to increased growth of vegetation in river channels, thus further narrowing of river width and sandbar habitat for wildlife"

			},{ "graf":

				"For decades, westbound settlers convinced by the adventure and lured by fortune in the frontier carted their wagons across the Platte, using its channels as a guiding path. Settlers chopped down riparian forests. Soon the railroad followed, and in its wake scores of small towns and bridges began to cross the languid river. Irrigation took root at points all along its length, pulling water out of the river for crops and livestock. Just after the turn of the twentieth century, the newly-formed Bureau of Reclamation began building damns and diversions in the headwaters, significantly changing the river system. Now, Platte River flows are estimated to be only a quarter of what they were historically."

			},{ "graf":

				"The Platte is a river of disturbance. But with these changes, the Platteâ€™s nature of ever-constant change began to stagnate. River channels no longer flooded in spring. Sandbars grew dense with woody vegetation. Birds struggled to find the habitat they had found on the Platte for centuries."
