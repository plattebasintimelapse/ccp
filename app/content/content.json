				"For thousands of years, climate was the principal force on the Platte River. The harsh extremes of prairie winters, stormy summers, drought, flood, and unrelenting winds shaped its wide channels and meanders. On the ground, millions of bison, the rugged Great Plains megafauna, used to trample earth, churn soil, graze grasses. Prairie fires raced across the landscape, turning grass into a carbon-rich delicacy for animals of all kinds. Ice formed in blocky sheets that carried gravel and knocked trees loose as they scraped down sandy straits. Each spring, snowmelt swept down from the mountains out to the broad, sinuous channels, reshaping sandbars, scouring vegetation, creating waterways anew."

				"Native American groups, especially the Pawnee, settled along the central stretch of the river and built villages along the banks. The historic prairie river was wide and shallow, with braided channels supporting a wide variety habitat and diverse ecological systems. The Pawnee hunted buffalo and other game across the plains, and farmed in the fertile soils of the river floodplain."

			},{ "graf":

				"Towards the end of the nineteenth century, things began to change. Starting with western explorers like Lewis and Clark, followed soon after by the fur trade trappers, westward expansion brought increasing numbers of settlers to the region. The human impact on the river grew. The U.S. government started moving Native American groups from their historical territories around the plains in the early 1800s, and continued through the homestead and land grant era."

				"For much of the 1800s, waves of westbound settlers—Gold Rush hopefuls, Mormons, eager homesteaders, lured by fortune and adventure in the frontier carted their wagons across the country, following trails along the Platte, giving it the name, “The Great Platte River Road.” Some travelers stayed, living off the land, chopping down riparian forests for timber. Soon the railroad followed, and in its wake scores of small towns and bridges began to cross the broad, languid river. Irrigation canals took root at points all along its length, pulling water out of the river for crops and livestock. Starting in the early twentieth century, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began building dams and diversions in the headwaters, significantly changing the river system."

			},{ "graf":

				"The Platte evolved as a river of disturbance. But with these changes, the Platte’s nature of ever-constant change began to stagnate. River channels no longer flooded in spring, with water held back by dams or diverted for irrigation. Sandbars grew dense with woody vegetation. Birds struggled to find the habitat they had used on the Platte for centuries, instead finding fields of corn and beans."

			},{ "graf":

				"Now, Platte River flows are estimated to be only a quarter of what they were historically. And the river channel width, in many places have been reduced by the same amount or more. By the early twentieth century, human activity, rather than climate, became the dominant factor shaping the Platte River."
