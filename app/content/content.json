				"For thousands of years, climate was the principal force shaping the Platte River. The harsh extremes of frigid winters, stormy summers, drought, flood, and unrelenting winds formed the braided channels and meanders of its broad valley. On the ground, millions of bison, the rugged Great Plains megafauna, grazed the prairie, trampling the earth and fertilizing the soil. Beaver built dams and engineered elaborate wetland complexes. Prairie fires raced across the landscape, disturbing grass and burning down trees. Ice formed in blocky sheets, flooding the lowlands and bulldozing trees and gravel down sandy straits. Each spring, snowmelt swept down from the mountains out to the broad, sinuous channels, reshaping sandbars, scouring vegetation and creating waterways anew."

			},{ "graf":

				"The historic prairie river was one to two miles wide and shallow, with small, sparsely wooded islands and braided channels supporting a wide variety of habitat and diverse ecological systems. For thousands of years Native American groups roamed through the Platte Valley. By the late 1600s, the Pawnee settled along the lower Platte Valley (near the Missouri confluence) and the Loup River, a tributary of the Platte, and built large earthlodge villages where they farmed corn, beans and squash. They frequented the central Platte on hunting trips, sometimes building seasonal tipi camps from which they hunted bison, elk and smaller game, and gathered wild plants."

				"As Euro-American explorers started arriving to colonize this new land, the Platte River Valley began to change. Beginning in the late seventeenth century, the Spanish, French, and other colonial settlers introduced native groups to horses, guns, and other trade goods as well as deadly Old World diseases. These changes affected native settlement, social and subsistence patterns and in some cases caused further friction between warring groups."

			},{ "graf":

				"In the early nineteenth century, starting with explorers like Lewis and Clark, westward expansion brought increasing numbers of Euro-American settlers to the region. The human population, and impact on the river, grew."

				"For the first half of the 1800s, explorers, fur traders and trappers, Mormons, Oregon Trail and Gold Rush hopefuls headed west. Lured by fortune and adventure in the frontier, thousands carted their wagons across the country, carving trails along the river and giving it the name, “The Great Platte River Road.” Later, waves of eager homesteaders followed, settling land formerly claimed by native people. White hunters decimated the buffalo to sell hides back east. New settlers clashed with resident Native American groups, resulting in decades of unrest and conflict as the American military conquered the west under the concept of manifest destiny."

			},{ "graf":

				"Those who stayed tried to make a living off the land, plowing up prairie and chopping down riparian forests for timber. The mid-century westward expansion of the railroad created scores of small towns in its wake and spurred the building of bridges to cross the broad river. Irrigation canals took root at points all along its length, pulling water out of the river for crops, livestock, and power generation. In the early twentieth century, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation began building major dams and diversions in the headwaters, significantly changing the seasonal flows of water."

				"The Platte evolved as a river shaped by natural disturbance. But with these new man-made changes, the Platte’s ever-changing nature began to stagnate. Beaver trapping, mining, farming and timber harvest all left their mark on the river system. With water held back by dams or diverted for irrigation, river flows and channel width declined by as much as 80 percent. Channels no longer flooded in spring. Sandbars grew dense with woody vegetation. Wetlands were drained or plowed under. Bridges constrained the banks. Birds struggled to find the habitat they had used on the Platte for centuries, instead finding monoculture fields of corn and beans."

				"By the early twentieth century, human activity, rather than climate, became the dominant factor shaping the Platte River."

As the birds have for centuries, each spring they migrate from their wintering grounds along the Texas Gulf Coast to their breeding grounds in Canada, stopping over at lakes, rivers, and wetlands throughout the Great Plains, particularly the Platte River in central Nebraska."

			},{ "graf":
				"Cranes prefer shallow wetlands and marshes for roosting and a wide field of view to spot predators. As dams and diversions for agriculture, cities and hydropower significantly reduced flows through the central Platte in the late 1800s and early 1900s, vegetation normally scoured out by spring floods instead took root. Wide stretches of the Platte became unsuitable habitat, threatening the bird’s survival. Combined with hunting and habitat losses in other parts of the bird’s migratory flyway, by the 1940s, only 16 whooping cranes remained in the wild."

				"For environmental activists, the whooping crane became a cause célèbre —a charismatic bird under threat that symbolized the need for environmental protections. Its listing as one of the country’s first endangered species paralleled the national turn of attention toward the environment. The habitat requirements for the whooping crane were hammered out during the same few years that most of the country’s bedrock environmental laws were passed in the 1970s: the National Environmental Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, and Endangered Species Act, and the establishment of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency."

The National Wildlife Federation and state of Nebraska opposed the project, arguing the dam would further compromise wildlife habitat and irrigation needs downstream."
			},{ "graf":

Construction of Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir was allowed to proceed as long as the power companies limited their annual water use and created a trust fund dedicated to protecting and enhancing whooping crane habitat."

Part of Kingsley Dam relicensing agreement included the creation of an “environmental account” of water at Lake McConaughy that can be released when needed for wildlife."

				"Sandhill cranes have migrated through the Central Platte Valley for eons. The Platte River’s braided channels offered refuge for birds on their way north, but historically they traversed a much greater span of the river than they do today, foraging in marshes and wet meadows and roosting on shallow sandbars in the river."
			},{ "graf":
				"As human impacts began to change the character of the river, suitable habitat along its length began to disappear. But the conversion of wetland habitat to irrigated agriculture along the river floodplain had an unexpected benefit for some birds: waste corn left over from the previous fall’s harvest. For decades this rich food source in fields near the river has helped cranes build fat reserves for the journey to the frigid high north to breed, but in recent years, more efficient harvesting practices have diminished this alternate food source as well."

One of the outcomes of the Platte’s recent litigious history is today’s high concentration of federal, state, and private entities working toward conservation in a 100-mile stretch of the central Platte, often referred to as the “Big Bend” region, driven in part by habitat requirements mandated under the Endangered Species Act."

They are the most recent member of a loose collective of federal, state and private organizations and people who have spent decades working on these issues along the Platte. While many groups work together on specific projects, each group has distinct priorities and goals."
			},{ "graf":

Most of the groups active in the river valley agree their habitat work is made better by their diverse opinions and approaches, which foster ongoing conversation about best practices for modern river management."

				"This complex collection of federal, state, and private groups use most of the same tools and techniques to achieve wildlife and habitat restoration in the region. Those include finding ways to return more water back to the river, removing vegetation from the river channel and recreating sandbars, side channels and shallows that provide critical roosts for cranes and nesting habitat for terns and plovers. It also means employing modern techniques to mimic the historical disturbances on the river valley, like managing nearby wetlands and grasslands with fire and cattle."

				"The goal of these groups is not to restore the Platte to a certain time in the past, a time when the river may have been considered more “pristine.” Rivers are ever changing; they continue to evolve in response to complex conditions and environmental factors. Rather, the groups try to work within the complicated set of modern demands on the river to maximize benefits for the species they’re targeting. That means cooperation between what some might consider unusual wildlife partners, like power companies and irrigation districts."
			},{ "graf":
				"Private landowners also play a large role, working with groups to allow conservation work on their properties. That’s important because nearly the entire state of Nebraska, including most of the lands along the Platte, is privately owned, and much of it is devoted to agriculture. Still, sentiment in the central Platte isn’t uniformly in support of restoration—some multigenerational farmers criticize the land acquisition by conservation groups and feel they’re being pushed out of the river valley, or question the value and need of the habitat work itself."

Yet without the year-round efforts of these various groups and landowners to maintain the remaining habitat, it’s unlikely we’d see anything like the crane migration spectacle each spring, or the diversity of other species that inhabit the central Platte region."
